# FlexAccess - Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Product Overview

**Product Name:** FlexAccess  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Document Date:** July 15, 2025  
**Product Type:** Mobile-First Progressive Web Application (PWA)

## Executive Summary

FlexAccess is a comprehensive gym membership pod sharing platform that transforms how people access premium fitness facilities. Built specifically for Bay Club members, the platform replaces ad-hoc WhatsApp coordination with a secure, streamlined experience for discovering and joining membership "pods" - shared memberships that make high-end fitness accessible and affordable.

## Problem Statement

**Core Challenge:** Bay Club memberships are expensive ($227-$445/month), leading to informal cost-sharing arrangements scattered across WhatsApp groups with unclear pricing, limited trust mechanisms, and manual payment coordination.

**Target Users:**
- **Pod Seekers:** Individuals wanting affordable access to premium fitness facilities
- **Pod Leaders:** Primary account holders looking to share membership costs
- **Fitness Enthusiasts:** Users valuing tennis, multi-club access, and family amenities

## Solution Overview

FlexAccess provides a centralized platform where users can discover pods, request membership, and manage shared gym memberships through intuitive dashboards and secure coordination tools.
